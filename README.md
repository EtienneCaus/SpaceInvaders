This simple Space Invaders game was a project I've made for school back in 2023



It was made with C/C++ only using the SFML library.

The project was made using vscode, and debugged with gdb


The game uses the mouse to move the player, and the right mouse button to fire.

When you destroy all of the ennemies, the screen fills up again and the speed of the game goes up.

You will need to install SFML to play this game
